# Intel Unnati Data Analysis

This repository contains Python and Power BI projects for analyzing data provided by Intel Unnati. The analysis focuses on extracting meaningful patterns and insights from the data.

## Overview

This project explores and analyzes the Intel Unnati dataset to identify trends, patterns, and key insights.  It utilizes Python for data processing, manipulation, and analysis, and Power BI for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data and uncover valuable information that can be used for decision-making or further investigation.

## Features

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Python scripts for cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.  *(Specify the cleaning techniques used, e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates, data type conversion.)*
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Python scripts for performing EDA to understand the data distribution, identify correlations, and uncover initial insights. *(Mention the specific EDA techniques used, e.g., descriptive statistics, data visualization.)*
* **Feature Engineering:** *(If implemented)* Python scripts for creating new features from the existing data to improve the analysis or modeling.
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI dashboards and reports for visualizing the analyzed data and presenting the findings in an interactive and user-friendly manner. *(Describe the key visualizations created and the insights they reveal.)*
* **Pattern Identification:**  Analysis to identify significant patterns and trends in the data. *(Specify the patterns identified and their significance.)*
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features (e.g., predictive modeling, specific statistical analyses).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis in Python.
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
NumPy: For numerical operations in Python.
Bash

pip install numpy
Matplotlib/Seaborn: (If used) For data visualization in Python.
Bash

pip install matplotlib seaborn
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and reports. (Specify the Power BI version used, if relevant.)
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used (e.g., scikit-learn for machine learning, if applicable).
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
